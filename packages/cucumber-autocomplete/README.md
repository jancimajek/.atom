#### FAQs
* __When does it provide suggestions?__ Type a keyword (`And`, `Then`, `When`, `Given`) in a `.feature` file to trigger suggestions
* __What does it scan?__ The package scans a directory of your choice, by default it scans the `/features` directory of your project. You override the default by changing the path option under settings.
